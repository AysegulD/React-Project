first step npm install /cd react-project
second step npm start/ run the app to view it in the browser.
run the back end to see the header section.


Decisions I have made in the task:
1. To be able to enable cors in ASP.NET, I had to configure a CORS policy at application startup in the ConfigureSevices method,I set the AllowAnyOrigin.
2. In the front-end task,you were asked to use the node==12.x npm == 6.x but documentation says you will need to use Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine,so I decided to follow the documentation.
