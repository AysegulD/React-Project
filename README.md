first step cd react-project
second step npm start/ run the app to view it in the browser.


Decisions I have made in the task:
1. To be able to enable cors in ASP.NET, I had to configure a CORS policy at application startup in the ConfigureSevices method,I set the AllowAnyOrigin.
2. In the task for the front-end part,it was asked for to use the node==12.x npm == 6.x but in the documentation it is saying you will need to use Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6 in your machine,so I decided to follow the documentation.
